# AlkalineReuse
a simple way to reuse alkaline cells

This repository contains schematics, PCB design and software to create a simple alkaline cell charger.

The design is built around a small AVR MCU, the attiny10. Of course, other AVR MCUs can be use without changing the software at all.

Depending on your experiments, you can adjust *charging_time* and *idle_time* of charge cycles.
